Machine Learning
Task 1 :
Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SMxwWg5DjKEPwdhPM_590he60S1GrfhU/view?usp=sharing and perform the following actions:

Preprocess the data.
Plot a detailed respective graph for each column.
Analyse the data properly and train the most suitable machine learning to analyse if the person is diabetic.
Test the trained model
Evaluate the model and tune the model to maximize the accuracy
Task 2:
Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/18T3IZpr4GeoCho0MbF_bqjp1tGGHLk2A/view?usp=sharing and perform the following task :

Preprocess the data
Analyse the data and train a model that divides this data into multiple groups.
Determine what would be the best number of groups we should divide the data.
Take two columns with the highest correlation and plot a graph between those columns to display the group formation.
Recommendation Engine
Task 3:
Download the datasets from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KRpbHyN8lvuXRgKqdWIz5NSVB_A9X6sm/view?usp=sharing and perform the following task.

The folder contains two data sets of movies. Merge both dataset on the basis of Title of Movies
Preprocess the provided data
Make a recommendation engine which consider important features like Genre, Keywords, crew, cast, overview etc.
The Input of the engine would be one movie, and in out put it should recommend 10 movies related to the selected movie.
Computer Vision
Task 4:
Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndCMh6mJ5LiO805cc3Q77K4p6hz7yEsV/view?usp=sharing The above link contains folder containing two images. Perform all the following tasks on both of the images. After performing each task display the image in the python notebook.

Image Loading:

Load an image from your local system using OpenCV.
Color Space Conversion:
Convert the image to grayscale and display it.

Convert the grayscale image to a different color space (e.g., HSV) and display it.
Image Filtering:

Apply Gaussian Blur to the original color image and display the result.
Apply a custom kernel for image smoothing (e.g., averaging) and display the result.
Edge Detection:

Apply Canny edge detection to the grayscale image and display the edges.
Contours:

Find and draw contours on the original image based on the edges obtained from Canny.
Histogram:

Compute and display the histogram of the grayscale image.
Object Detection:

Load a pre-trained object detection model and apply it to detect cars in the image. (In case of humans detect faces else detect the object present in the image)
Save Results:

ðŸ›  The above task must be done by using following skills :
Python
Pandas
Numpy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Scikit Learn
Keras / Pytorch
